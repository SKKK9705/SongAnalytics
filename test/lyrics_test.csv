0,1,Theme from A Summer Place,Percy Faith,1960,"There's a summer place
Where it may rain or storm
Yet I'm safe and warm
For within that summer place
Your arms reach out to me
And my heart is free from all care
For it knows
There are no gloomy skies
When seen through the eyes
Of those who are blessed with love
And the sweet secret of
A summer place
Is that it's anywhere
When two people share
All their hopes
All their dreams
All their love
And the sweet secret of a summer place
Is that it's anywhere
When two people share
All their hopes
All their dreams, all their love"
1,2,He'll Have to Go,Jim Reeves,1960,
2,3,Cathy's Clown,The Everly Brothers,1960,"[Hook]
Don't want your love any moreDon't want your kisses, that's for sure
I die each time I hear this sound
Here he comes, that's Cathy's clownI've got to stand tall, you know a man can't crawl
For when he knows you're telling lies
And he hears them passing by
He's not a man at all[Hook]
When you see me shed a tearAnd you know that it's sincere
Don't you think it's kind of sad, that you're treating me so bad?
Or don't you even care?
[Hook]
Don't want your love any more
Don't want your kisses , that's for sure
I die each time I hear this soundHere he comes, that's Cathy's clown
That's Cathy's clown, that's Cathy's clown"
3,4,Running Bear,Johnny Preston,1960,"On the bank of the river
Stood Running Bear, young Indian brave
On the other side of the river
Stood his lovely Indian maid
Little White Dove was her name
Such a lovely sight to see
But their tribes fought with each other
So their love could never be
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love big as the sky
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love that couldn't die
He couldn't swim the raging river
'Cause the river was too wide
He couldn't reach Little White Dove
Waiting on the other side
In the moonlight, he could see her
Throwing kisses 'cross the waves
Her little heart was beating faster
Waiting there for her Indian brave
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love big as the sky
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love that couldn't die
Running Bear dove in the water
Little White Dove did the same
And they swam out to each other
Through the swirling stream they came
As their hands touched and their lips met
The raging river pulled them down
Now they'll always be together
In their happy hunting ground
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love big as the sky
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love that couldn't die"

10,11,Everybody's Somebody's Fool,Connie Francis,1960,"The tears I cried for you could fill an ocean
But you don't care how many tears I cry
And though you only lead me on and hurt me
I couldn't bring myself to say goodbye
'Cause everybody's somebody's fool
Everybody's somebody's plaything
And there are no exceptions to the rule
Yes, everybody's somebody's fool
I told myself it's best that I forget you
Though I'm a fool, at least I know the score
Yet darlin', I'd be twice as blue without you
It hurts, but I come running back for more

Everybody's somebody's plaything

12,13,Greenfields,The Brothers Four,1960,"Once there were greenfields
Kissed by the sun
Once there were valleys where rivers used to run
Once there were blue skies with white clouds high above
Once they were part of an everlasting love
We were the lovers
Who strolled through greenfields
Greenfields are gone now
Parched by the sun
Gone from the valleys where rivers used to run
Gone with the cold wind that swept into my heart
Gone with the lovers who let their dreams depart
Where are the greenfields that we used to roam?
I'll never know what made you run away
How can I keep searching when dark clouds hide the day
(Oh) I only know there's nothing here for me
Nothing in this wide world
Left for me to see
But I'll keep on waiting
Till you return
I'll keep on waiting until the day you learn
You can't be happy while your heart's on a roam
You can't be happy until you bring it home
Home to the greenfields and me once again"

What in the world's come over you?

If you do, I'll still be here, dear
Waiting, longing for you

14,15,El Paso,Marty Robbins,1960,"Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girlNighttime would find me in Rosa's cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirlBlacker than night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spellMy love was deep for this Mexican maidenI was in love but in vain, I could tell
One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I loved
So in anger I challenged his right
For the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he woreMy challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run
Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tiedI caught a good one, it looked like it could run
Up on its back and away I did ride
Just as fast as I could from
The West Texas town of El Paso
Out to the badlands of New Mexico
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life; nothing is leftIt's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death
I saddled up and away I did go
Riding alone in the darkMaybe tomorrow, a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heartAnd at last here I
Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's cantina belowMy love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I goOff to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I have to make it to Rosa's back doorSomething is dreadfully wrong for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride
But my love forFelina is strong
And I rise where I've fallen
Though I am weary I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest
From out of nowhere Felina has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Felina, goodbyeSongwriter:  Marty Robbins"

16,17,My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own,Connie Francis,1960,"I told this heart of mine
Our love could never be
But then I hear your voice
And something stirs inside of me
Somehow I can't dismiss
The memory of your kiss
Guess my heart has a mind of its own
No matter what I do
No matter what I say
No matter how I try
I just can't turn the other way
When I'm with someone new
I always think of you
Guess my heart has a mind of its own
You're not in love with me
So why can't I forget?
I'm just your ""used-to-be""
It's wrong and yet
I know forgetting you
Would be a hopeless thing
For I'm a puppet and I
Just can't seem to break the string
I say I'll let you go
But then my heart says no
Guess my heart has a mine of its own
Guess my heart has a mind of its own"

The Germans had the biggest ship that had the biggest guns
The Bismarck was the fastest ship that ever sailed the sea
On her decks were guns as big as steers and shells as big as trees
Out of the cold and foggy night came the British ship the Hood
And every British seaman he knew and understood
They had to sink the Bismarck the terror of the sea
Stop those guns as big as steers and those shells as big as trees
We'll find the German battleship that's makin' such a fuss
We gotta sink the Bismarck 'cause the world depends on us
Yeah hit the decks a runnin' boys and spin those guns around
When we find the Bismarck we gotta cut her down
The Hood found the Bismarck and on that fatal day
The Bismarck started firing fifteen miles away
We gotta sink the Bismarck was the battle sound
But when the smoke had cleared away the mighty Hood went down
For six long days and weary nights they tried to find her trail
Churchill told the people put every ship asail
Cause somewhere on that ocean I know she's gotta be
We gotta sink the Bismarck to the bottom of the sea
We'll find the German battleship that's makin' such a fuss
We gotta sink the Bismarck 'cause the world depends on us
Yeah hit the decks a runnin' boys and spin those guns around
When we find the Bismarck we gotta cut her down
The fog was gone the seventh day and they saw the morning sun
Ten hours away from homeland the Bismarck made its run
The Admiral of the British fleet said turn those bows around
We found that German battleship and we're gonna cut her down
The British guns were aimed and the shells were coming fast
The first shell hit the Bismarck they knew she couldn't last
That mighty German battleship is just a memory
Sink the Bismarck was the battle cry that shook the seven seas
We found the German battleship 'twas makin' such a fuss
We had to sink the Bismarck cause the world depends on us
We hit the deck a runnin' and we and spun those guns around
Yeah we found the mighty Bismarck and then we cut her down

Working on the chain, gangAll day long they work so hard till the sun is going down
Working on the highways and byways and wearing, wearing a frown
You hear they moaning their lives away
Then you hear somebody say
That's the sound of the men
Working on the chain, ga-ang
That's the sound of the men
Working on the chain, gang
Can't you hear them singing, mmm (Hoh! Ah!)
I'm going home one of these days
I'm going home, see my woman
Whom I love so dear
But meanwhile I gotta work right here
(Well don't you know)
That's the sound of the men
Working on the chain, ga-ang
That's the sound of the men
Working on the chain, gang
All day long they're singing, mmm (Hoh! Ah!)
My work is so hard
Give me water
I'm thirsty, my work is so hard
Woah ooo
My work is so hard"
29,30,Let It Be Me,The Everly Brothers,1960,"I bless the day I found you
I want to stay around you
And so I beg you, let it be me
Don't take this heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever, let it be me
Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love what would life be
So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you'll always let it be me
Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love what would life be
So never leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you'll always---let--it‚Äîbe--me"
30,31,Good Timin',Jimmy Jones,1960,"Oh, you need timin'
A tick, a tick, a tick, good timin'
A tock, a tock, a tock, a tock
A timin' is the thing
It's true, good timin' brought me to you
If little, little David hadn't grabbed that stone
Alyin' there on the ground
Big Goliath might've stomped on him
Instead of the other way 'round
But he had timin'
A tick, a tick, a tick, good timin'
A tock, a tock, a tock, a tock
A timin' is the thing
It's true, good timin' brought me to you
Who in the world would've ever known
What Columbus could do
If Queen Isabella hadn't hocked her jewels
In fourteen ninety two
But she had timin'
A tick, a tick, a tick, good timin'
A tock, a tock, a tock, a tock
A timin' is the thing
It's true, good timin' brought me to you
What would've happened if you and I
Hadn't just happened to meet
We might've spent the rest of our lives
Walkin' down Misery Street
But we had timin'
A tick, a tick, a tick, good timin'
A tock, a tock, a tock, a tock
A timin' is the thing
It's true, good timin' brought me to you
Yeah, we had timin'
Whoa, whoa, whoa, good timin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, timin' is the thing
It's true, good timin' brought me to you
Yeah, we had timin'
Whoa, whoa, whoa, good timin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, timin' is the thing
It's true, good timin' brought me to you"
31,32,Beyond the Sea,Bobby Darin,1960,"Somewhere beyond the sea
Somewhere waiting for meMy lover stands on golden sands
And watches the ships that go sailingSomewhere beyond the sea
She's there watching for me
If I could fly like birds on high
Then straight to her arms
I'd go sailingIt's far beyond the stars
It's near beyond the moon
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soonWe'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon
We'll meet (I know we'll meet) beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea
And never again I'll go sailing
No more sailing
So long sailing
Bye, bye sailing..."
32,33,Go Jimmy Go,Jimmy Clanton,1960,"I told her when it comes to talking
I'm the sweetest sweet-talker in the world
She said you better start talking if you want me to be your girl
And she said, ""Go, Jimmy, go."" She said, ""Go, Jimmy, go.""
Well, I talked her off the floor when she said, ""Go, Jimmy, go.""
I told when it comes to dancing
I'm the best young dancer in the land
Well, she looked at me with a twinkle in her eyes
And then she took my hand
And she said, ""Go, Jimmy, go."" She said, ""Go, Jimmy, go.""
Well, I talked her off the floor when she said, ""Go, Jimmy, go.""
And she said, ""Go, Jimmy, go."" She said, ""Go, Jimmy, go.""
Well, I talked her off the floor when she said, ""Go, Jimmy, go.""
I told her when it comes to kissing
I ain't nothing but a kissing fool
She started to giggle when I told her that I'd teach her
Things she'd never learn in school
And she said, ""Go, Jimmy, go."" She said, ""Go, Jimmy, go.""
Well, I talked her off the floor when she said, ""Go, Jimmy, go."" ""Go
Jimmy, go."" ""Go, Jimmy, go"
33,34,Night,Jackie Wilson,1960,"Night, here comes the night
Another night to dream about you
Night, each lonely night
The only time I'm not without you
Once more, I feel your kisses
Once more, I know what bliss is
Comes dawn, my darling, you're gone
But you come back into my arms each night
Once more, I feel your kisses
Once more, I know what bliss is
Comes dawn, my darling, you're gone
But you come back into my arms each night"
